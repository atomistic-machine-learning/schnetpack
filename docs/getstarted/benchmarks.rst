Benchmarks and Trained Models
=============================

QM9 benchmarks
--------------
The QM9 benchmarks use a SchNet model with 128 features, 6 interaction blocks, 50
gaussians and a cosine cutoff-function with a cutoff at 10. The model is trained with
a batch size of 100 and an initial learning rate of 1e-4. The learning rate is
scheduled using spk.train.ReduceOnPlateauHook with a learning rate patience of 25, a
learning rate decay of 0.8 and a minimum learning rate of 1e-6. 100000 data-points
have been used for training and 10000 data-points are used for validation. The
remaining dataset is used for evaluating the test-set.

MD17 benchmarks
---------------
The MD17 benchmarks use a SchNet model with 64 features, 6 interaction blocks, 25
gaussians and a cosine cutoff-function with a cutoff at 5. The model is trained with
a batch size of 100 and an initial learning rate of 1e-3. The learning rate is
scheduled using spk.train.ReduceOnPlateauHook with a learning rate patience of 150, a
learning rate decay of 0.8 and a minimum learning rate of 1e-6. The loss tradeoff is
set to multiply the energy loss with 0.01 and the forces loss value with 0.99. 950
data-points have been used for training and 50 data-points are used for validation.
The remaining dataset is used for evaluating the test-set.
