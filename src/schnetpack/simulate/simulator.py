class Simulator:
    """
    Main driver of the molecular dynamics simulation. Uses an integrator to
    propagate the molecular system defined in the system class according to
    the forces yielded by a provided calculator.

    In addition, hooks can be applied at five different stages of each
    simulation step:
    -) Start of the simulation (e.g. for initializing thermostats)
    -) Before first integrator half step (e.g. thermostats)
    -) After computation of the forces and before main integrator step (e.g.
       for accelerated MD)
    -) After second integrator half step (e.g. thermostats, output routines)
    -) At the end of the simulation (e.g. general wrap up of file writes, etc.)

    This routine has a state dict which can be used to restart a previous
    simulation.

    Args:
        system (object): Instance of the system class defined in
                         molecular_dynamics.system holding the structures,

                         all molecules and their replicas

                             dynamics simulation, defined in

                                        during simulations. Examples would be
