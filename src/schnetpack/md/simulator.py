This class collects the atomistic system (:obj:`schnetpack.md.System`), calculators (:obj:`schnetpack.md.calculators`),
integrators (:obj:`schnetpack.md.integrators`) and various simulation hooks (:obj:`schnetpack.md.simulation_hooks`)

class Simulator(nn.Module):
    """
    Main driver of the molecular dynamics simulation. Uses an integrator to
    propagate the molecular system defined in the system class according to
    the forces yielded by a provided calculator.

    In addition, hooks can be applied at five different stages of each
    simulation step:
     - Start of the simulation (e.g. for initializing thermostat)
     - Before first integrator half step (e.g. thermostat)
     - After computation of the forces and before main integrator step (e.g.
      for accelerated MD)
     - After second integrator half step (e.g. thermostat, output routines)
     - At the end of the simulation (e.g. general wrap up of file writes, etc.)

    This routine has a state dict which can be used to restart a previous
    simulation.

    Args:
        system (schnetpack.md.System): Instance of the system class defined in
                         molecular_dynamics.system holding the structures,
                         masses, atom type, momenta, forces and properties of
                         all molecules and their replicas
        integrator (schnetpack.md.Integrator): Integrator for propagating the molecular
                             dynamics simulation, defined in
                             schnetpack.md.integrators
        calculator (schnetpack.md.calculator): Calculator class used to compute molecular
                             forces for propagation and (if requested)
                             various other properties.
        simulator_hooks (list(object)): List of different hooks to be applied
                                        during simulations. Examples would be
                                        file loggers and thermostat.
        step (int): Index of the initial simulation step.
        restart (bool): Indicates, whether the simulation is restarted. E.g. if set to True, the simulator tries to
                        continue logging in the previously created dataset. (default=False)
                        This is set automatically by the restart_simulation function. Enabling it without the function
                        currently only makes sense if independent simulations should be written to the same file.
        progress (bool): show progress bar during simulation. Can be deactivated e.g. for cluster runs.
