        == Config ==
        This is the config generated for this run.

        -------
        $CONFIG
        -------

        You can overide the config file with a pre-defined experiment config
        > spktrain experiment=qm9

        or your own experiment config, which needs to be located in a directory called `experiment` in the config search
        path, e.g.,
        > spktrain --config-dir=./my_configs experiment=my_experiment

        with your experiment config located at `./my_configs/experiment/my_experiment.yaml`.
        Your current working directory as well as an optional config subdirectory are automatically in the config
        search path. Therefore, you can put your experiment config either in `$PWD/experiment`,
        or `$PWD/configs/experiment`.

        You can also override everything with the command line, for example:
        > spktrain experiment=qm9 data_dir=/path/to/datadir data.batch_size=50
