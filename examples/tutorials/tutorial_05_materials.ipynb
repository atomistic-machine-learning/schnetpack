    "Machine learning force fields for studying materials has become increasingly popular. However, the large size of the physical systems associated with most materials requires some tricks to keep the amount of compute and required data sufficiently low. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will describe some of those tricks and how they can be implemented in the SchNetPack pipeline, namely:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **periodic boundary conditions (PBC)**: PBC allow to effectively reduce the number of simulated particles to only a fraction of the actual system's size. This is achieved by considering a relatively small simulation box, which is periodically repeated at its boundaries. In most cases, the resulting simulated periodic structure is a good approximation of the system under consideration.\n",
    "- **cached neighbor lists**: For large systems, the computation of all neighbors is expensive. In the training procedure this problem can be circumvented by utilizing neighbor list caching. This way, the neighbors must only be computed in the first epoch. In the subsequent epochs the cached neighbor lists can be loaded, which reduces the training time tremendously.\n",
    "- **neighbor lists with skin buffer**: In the scope of molecular dynamics simulations or structure relaxations, caching neighbor lists is not possible since the neighborhoods change with each integration step. Hence, it is recommended to use a neighbor list that utilizes a so-called skin buffer. The latter represents a thin layer that extends the cutoff region. It allows to reuse the calculated neighbor lists for samples with similar atomic positions. Only when at least one atom penetrates the skin buffer, the neighbor list is recalculated.\n",
    "- **filtering out neighbors (neighbor list postprocessing)**: Also in the feed forward pass of the network, a large number of neighbors, and thus interactions, can result in slow inference and training. In some scenarios it is crucial to have as few operations as possible in the model to ensure fast inference. This can be achieved, e.g., by filtering out some neighbors from the neighbor list.\n",
    "- **prediction target emphasizing**: In some occasions it may be useful to exclude the properties of some atoms from the training procedure. For example you might want to focus the training on the forces of only some atoms and neglect the rest. An exemplary use case would be a model used for structure optimization where some atoms are fixed during the simulation (zero forces). Or when filtering out neighbors of certain atoms, it might be reasonable to exclude the corresponding atomic properties from the training loss. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following tutorial, we will first describe how the dataset must be prepared to allow for utilizing the above-mentioned tricks. Subsequently, we explain how the configs in the SchNetPack framework must be adapted for training and inference, accordingly. The dataset preparation part is based on the tutorial script \"tutorial_01_preparing_data\". Please make sure you have understood the concepts introduced there, before continuing with this tutorial."

For the purpose of this tutorial we will create a new dataset and add the Si$_{16}$ diamond structure to the database. More structures can be added to the dataset by repeating the process with more datapoints in an iterative manner. In order to create the sample structure we need the atomic positions, the cell shape and the atom types. Furthermore, we want to add the properties \"energy\", \"forces\" and \"stress\" to our dataset."

    "In the framework of MD simulations and structure relaxations it is preferable to utilize neighbor lists with skin buffers. The corresponding class in SchNetPack is called ``schnetpack.transform.SkinNeighborList``. It takes as an argument a conventional neighbor list class such as, e.g., ASENeighborList, post-processing transforms for manipulating the neighbor lists and the cutoff skin which defines the size of the skin buffer around the actual cutoff region. Please choose a sufficiently large cutoff skin value to ensure that between two subsequent samples no atom can penetrate through the skin into the cutoff sphere of another atom if it is not in the neighbor list of that atom."
