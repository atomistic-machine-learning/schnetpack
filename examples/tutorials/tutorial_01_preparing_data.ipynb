    "This tutorial introduces how SchNetPack stores and loads data.\n",
    "Before we can start training neural networks with SchNetPack, we need to prepare our data.\n",
    "This is because SchNetPack has to stream the reference data from disk during training in order to be able to handle large datasets.\n",
    "Therefore, it is crucial to use data format that allows for fast random read access.\n",
    "We found that the [ASE database format](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/ase/db/db.html) fulfills this criterion perfectly.\n",
    "To further improve the performance, we internally encode properties in binary.\n",
    "However, as long as you only access the ASE database via the provided SchNetPack `ASEAtomsData` class, you don't have to worry about that."

    "To get a better initialization of the network and avoid numerical issues, we often want to make use of simple statistics of our target properties. The most simple approach is to subtract the mean value of our target property from the labels before training such that the neural networks only have to learn the difference from the mean prediction. A more sophisticated approach is to use so-called atomic reference values that provide basic statistics of our target property based on the atom types in a structure. This is especially useful for extensive properties such as the energy, where the single atom energies contribute a major part to the overall value. If your data comes with atomic reference values, you can add them to the metadata of your `ase` database. The statistics have to be stored in a dictionary with the property names as keys and the atomic reference values as lists where the list indices match the atomic numbers.
